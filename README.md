**Problem**
Make a program that take a list of grocery, and store it in a text file called **gorcerylist.txt**, finally print the gorcerylist.txt.


> Follow the implementation steps to have better understanding.

**Implementation**
Create either array or list of grocery list items. Then write the list of grocery to a text file. Then read the text file and print its value.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
// Import fstream lib

int main () {

    // Your Code Here
    // Create a list of grocery either by using an array or list

    // add values to the grocery list that you have created
    
    // insert it in file called grocerylist.txt
    
    // print the grocerylist.txt

    return 0;
}
```
